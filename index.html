                    <h5>What is WordPress</h5>
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/WordPress.svg/1200px-WordPress.svg.png" alt="" width="95%" height="545"><br><br>
                    <p>WordPress is a content manager used by millions of websites around the world, from small blogs to large websites.

                        Its great popularity lies in the fact that it is a simple but very powerful platform that offers us many possibilities to create, personalize and take our websites to the level we want.
                        
                        In other words, WordPress is much more than a platform that allows us to create and publish content on the Internet.</p><br>

                    <code>he template is the design of your WordPress site</code>
                    <p>Install a template in WordPress</p>
                    <p>The template is the design of your WordPress site. The content you create will adapt to that design, which you also have the option to customize.</p><br>
                        
                    <p>At any time, you can change the template of your WordPress site without affecting the content you already have created. Simply, with the installation of a new template, the contents will adapt to the new design.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Your WordPress includes several templates installed as standard. You can check it by accessing the "Appearance" menu from the left sidebar and clicking on "Themes".</p><br>

                        <p>Once you have decided, simply click on the "Activate" option.</p><br>

                    <p>User and profile management</p><br><br>
                        <p>By installing your WordPress you will have created your user profile automatically. From there, you can edit your profile information and you can add new users, assign them a role to filter the functions they can and cannot perform, etc.</p><br>
                        
                        You can do this by accessing the "Users" menu on the left sidebar.</p><br>

                        <p>In the "All users" option you can access the information of the users to whom you have given access to your WordPress, to the role or profile assigned to them and which will determine the permissions they have, the number of entries for each user, etc.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>At any time, from here you can delete a user or modify their profile (role).</p><br>
                        
                        <p>In the "Add New" option you can add a new user so that they have access to your WordPress and determine the profile or role they are going to have: administrator, subscriber, editor, collaborator or author. You can add as many users as you want.</p><br>
                        
                        <img src="https://romualdfons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/a%C3%B1adir-usuario-wordpress.png" alt="" width="95%" height="445">
                        
                        <p>WordPress user profiles</p><br>
                        <p>Before adding a new user, you must determine very well the profile that you want to assign him because, depending on this role, you will be giving him access to be able to perform some actions or others.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Let's see the different user profiles and their corresponding permissions:</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Administrator: is the profile with maximum authority. Initially, you are the administrator of your website, but you can also add other administrators if you think necessary, taking into account that you will be giving them control of EVERYTHING.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Editor: This profile has full access to all content on the website. You can create new entries, edit any article, delete any user's post and moderate, manage and reply to comments. But you do not have permission to modify any of the website settings, manage plugins or templates or add new users.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Author:  This profile can only add and publish new entries and edit or delete their own entries.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Contributor: This profile can only write new posts, but unlike the “author” these articles will not be published without the prior moderation of an editor or administrator.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Subscriber: You can access the private content of the website, but you cannot write or post entries.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>Finally, in the option "Your profile" you can edit the information of your WordPress profile.</p><br>
